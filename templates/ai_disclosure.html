            <p style="margin-bottom: 0; color: #856404;">All content generated by EduRipple is AI-assisted and must be reviewed by a qualified teacher before use in any classroom setting. AI-generated content is a starting point — not a replacement for professional judgement.</p>

        <h2>How EduRipple Uses AI</h2>
        <p>EduRipple uses artificial intelligence to help Kenyan CBC teachers create educational resources more efficiently. Here's how it works:</p>

        <h3>Content Generation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lesson Plans:</strong> AI generates structured lesson plans based on the CBC curriculum data stored in our system. Content is enriched using strands, sub-strands, learning outcomes, and assessment criteria from KICD guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Schemes of Work:</strong> AI creates termly/annual schemes with week-by-week breakdowns aligned to CBC standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Assessment Rubrics:</strong> AI produces marking rubrics with performance level descriptors.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio & Video:</strong> AI-powered text-to-speech and video generation create multimedia learning resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AI Providers</h3>
        <p>EduRipple uses the following AI services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Gemini</strong> — Primary AI model for content generation</li>
            <li><strong>OpenRouter</strong> — Fallback AI service for reliability</li>
            <li><strong>ElevenLabs</strong> — Text-to-speech for audio content</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Limitations of AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>Teachers should be aware of these limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> AI may occasionally produce incorrect facts or figures. Always verify factual content.</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> AI training data has a cut-off date. The latest KICD updates may not be reflected.</li>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> AI cannot fully understand your specific classroom dynamics, student abilities, or school resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias:</strong> AI models may reflect biases present in their training data.</li>
            <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Generated content may not cover all aspects required by your specific school or county requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Teacher Responsibility</h2>
        <p>As a professional educator, you are responsible for:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Reviewing</strong> all AI-generated content before using it in class.</li>
            <li><strong>Verifying</strong> that content aligns with the latest CBC guidelines from KICD.</li>
            <li><strong>Adapting</strong> content to match your students' needs and learning levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensuring</strong> factual accuracy of all information in generated materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercising</strong> professional judgement about what is appropriate for your classroom.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Data & AI Ethics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Prompts you submit are processed by AI providers to generate responses. Your personal information is not shared with AI providers.</li>
            <li>We do not use student data in AI training or content generation.</li>
            <li>EduRipple is committed to responsible AI use in education.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>If you notice any issues with AI-generated content — factual errors, inappropriate material, or curriculum misalignment — please report it through our <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">Contact page</a> so we can improve the system.</p>
